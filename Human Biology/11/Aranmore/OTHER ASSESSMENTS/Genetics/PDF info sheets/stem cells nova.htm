<em>Human embryonic stem cells burst into the headlines in 1998 and
have made regular appearances ever since. Newspapers love controversy.
But why is the issue so controversial? </em>

Stem
cells promise to be a powerful new technology that can't be ignored. Proponents say they
will revolutionise medicine, while opponents call them Frankenstein technology.
Just what are these headline-making cells?

</p><p><strong>What are stem cells?</strong>

</p><p>Most of the 300
trillion cells of the body have completely specialised functions.&nbsp;&nbsp; Blood, lung, brain, skin or liver cells are
all wonderfully specialised for what they do. By and large, they cannot do
anything other than what they were designed for. Stem cells, on the other hand,
do not have a specialised function; they are an immature kind of cell that
still has the potential to develop into many different kinds of cell. They are 'all-purpose' cells.&nbsp; 

</p><p>There is another
characteristic of stem cells that makes them so prized. Unlike our specialist
cells, stem cells have the capacity to keep multiplying. This capacity to both
proliferate and form different types of cells makes them ideal for replacing
tissue that is lost. Need new pancreatic cells to replace the one you've lost
to diabetes?&nbsp; Let stem cells churn them
out for you. That's the potential of stem cells and the reason why research
scientists, biotech companies and sick people are so passionate about having
the freedom to develop that potential.

<strong>Two types of stem cells</strong>

</p><p>Scientists
distinguish between two types of stem cells: embryonic stem cells and adult
stem cells. Embryonic stem cells are obtained from surplus 5-day-old
embryos. Such embryos are produced in the 'test-tube' for infertile couples,
but often more are produced than needed.&nbsp;
These surplus embryos are stored in the freezer and normally thrown away
after 5 years. Embryonic stem cells, derived from surplus embryos, can be
programmed to become any cell of the body. They also have the capacity to keep
proliferating indefinitely in a culture dish.

</p><p>Adult stem cells exist in certain mature tissues and supply
the tissue with replacement cells throughout life. For instance, our blood stem
cells churn out 5 million cells per second!&nbsp;
Until recently, only tissues like blood and skin, which replace
themselves prodigiously, were thought to have stem cells. Now it seems that
whichever organ researchers look at, they find stem cells, even when those
organs don't seem to be very good at replacing their lost cells, like the brain
or pancreas.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

</p><p>Compared to
embryonic stem cells, which can make replacement cells for any tissue, adult
stem cells are normally dedicated to making the cells for one particular
tissue. For instance, skin stem cells usually can only make skin, not brain or
blood. And when isolated and placed in the culture dish, they don't grow
indefinitely as embryonic stem cells do.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

</p><p>
<strong>Cures from stem cells</strong>

</p><p>Type 1 diabetes and Parkinson's disease
are seen as good candidates for stem cell therapy. Both diseases cause the loss
of a relatively small amount of tissue. In juvenile diabetics, the <a href="http://www.science.org.au/nova/079/079glo.htm#insulin">insulin</a>-producing
cells of the pancreas are destroyed by the immune system. In Parkinson's
disease the <a href="http://www.science.org.au/nova/079/079glo.htm#dopamine">dopamine</a>-producing cells of the brain are destroyed &#8211; no-one
really knows why.&nbsp;&nbsp; Researchers have
already had some success treating patients by replacing the lost tissue with
material from aborted fetuses (in the case of Parkinson's disease) or donated
pancreases (in the case of type 1 diabetes).

</p><p>But aborted fetuses and donated organs
are not the solution to the problem. Not only is the quality of these
tissues unreliable, but the amount
available is a drop in the bucket compared to the numbers of patients
who would
benefit from stem cell therapy. It has already been shown to work in
mice
suffering from symptoms of Parkinson's disease. In time, human stem
cells might provide an endless supply of high quality material to treat
all patients.
</p><p>Most researchers believe it is essential to carry out
research on both embryonic and adult stem cells. Both have advantages and
drawbacks. Researchers cannot yet say which types of cells will work best. In
general, the advantage of starting with embryonic stem cells is that they can
be grown in large quantities, but at some point the researcher has to train
these cells to become dopamine-producing brain cells or insulin-producing
pancreatic cells, and that is the difficult part.

</p><p>On the other hand,
adult stem cells taken from the brain or pancreas are already programmed to
make brain or pancreas cells. The problem is they don't grow very well in the
culture dish. And it is difficult to procure spare adult stem cells.&nbsp; At the moment, researchers use cadavers to
obtain brain and pancreatic stem cells.&nbsp;&nbsp;


</p><p><strong>Two biological hurdles to stem cell therapy</strong>

</p><p>Any stem cell therapy will have to clear two hurdles.

</p><p>
<strong><em>Immune rejection</em></strong><br>
The first hurdle to clear is <a href="http://www.science.org.au/nova/079/079glo.htm#immune%20rejection">immune rejection</a>. Patients receiving a graft of embryonic
stem cells or adult stem cells sourced from cadavers would probably be treated
in much the same way that organ transplant recipients are treated. The grafts
would be matched to the individual patient and anti-rejection drugs would be
used. Patients receiving brain cells may not need these drugs; the brain seems
to get away with less surveillance by the immune system than other parts of the
body.&nbsp; And there is one type of stem
cell known as a <a href="http://www.science.org.au/nova/079/079glo.htm#mesenchymal%20stem%20cell">mesenchymal stem cell</a> that seems to evade detection by
the immune system. Everyone carries mesenchymal stem cells in their bone
marrow; they normally give rise to cartilage, bone or muscle cells. If these
cells do not trigger immune rejection they could be used in future treatments
of bone and joint diseases or repair heart muscle damaged during a heart
attack.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

</p><p>If patients
provide their own stem cells, then of course immune rejection is no problem.
Leukaemia patients routinely rely on their own stem cells. A reserve of their
blood-forming stem cells (found in bone marrow, but different from mesenchymal
stem cells) is stored away. After cancer therapy, which destroys stem cells,
patients rely on the stored stem cells to rapidly restore their red and white
blood cell counts to normal.&nbsp; Burn
patients rely on the stem cells present in a tiny square patch of skin to seed
the growth of metres of new skin in the culture dish.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</p><p>

<strong><em>Cancer</em></strong><br>
Any stem cell, adult or embryonic, has the ammunition
it needs to give rise to cancer: an explosive ability to grow and to change
into other types of cells.&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact,
researchers now realise that at the heart of many common cancers lies an adult
stem cell gone awry. 

</p><p>Any stem cell lines injected into patients have to be
carefully tested first in animals to see if they give rise to cancer. Though
cautious, researchers believe they will be able to tame the tendency of stem
cells to form cancers. 

</p><p><strong>Opposition to embryonic stem cell research</strong>

</p><p>Some people oppose embryonic stem cell research on
religious grounds.&nbsp;&nbsp; Many Catholics, for
instance, take the view that from the moment of conception an embryo is a human
being with a soul, and that using these embryos is like dismembering a
person.&nbsp; But not all religious people
take this view. Some believe that an individual human being does not truly arise
until the embryo has implanted into the wall of the mother's womb at around 14
days. According to that view, these embryos are too primitive to be to
considered human beings and so it is
not unethical to use them for life-saving research, especially if they
are to be thrown away in any case. 

</p><p>Some people even
argue it is unethical NOT to use embryonic stem cells to search for cures for
diseases. Though no-one can guarantee that such research will be successful,
embryonic stem cells offer new hope. As with many problems of ethics, it comes
down to balancing the needs of one party versus another. In this case it is a
matter of weighing the hopes of sick people for a cure against the beliefs of
another group of people.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

</p><p>Some people are
fearful of human embryonic stem cell research, because they see it as yet
another step on the slippery slide that will lead to widespread human cloning.
In the public mind, the techniques for cultivating embryonic stem cells seem
linked to cloning, but they are actually separate technologies.&nbsp; Researchers could happily go ahead
developing embryonic stem cells to provide replacement tissue for patients
without ever touching cloning techniques.

</p><p>But having said
that, some researchers would like to combine cloning techniques with embryonic
stem cell culture techniques &#8211; not for the purpose of cloning an individual,
but for growing replacement tissue that is perfectly matched to a patient.
This would eliminate the need for life-long use of anti-rejection drugs. 

</p><p><strong>Stem cells and cloning legislation</strong>
</p><p>After extensive debate, the Australian Parliament passed
legislation in 2002 that regulates embryonic stem cell research and
cloning. The legislation is more liberal than that of the United States
legislation, but stricter than that of the United Kingdom (<a href="http://www.science.org.au/nova/079/079box01.htm">Box 1: How has stem cell research been legislated in Australia, the US and the UK?</a>).
But because new developments are emerging all the time, legislation is
hard pressed to keep up. For example, in August 2003 researchers in
China reported using rabbit eggs to carry out human 'therapeutic
cloning'.&nbsp; The eggs were used to reprogram human skin cells to
become embryos. Once embryos had formed, researchers cultivated stem
cells from them. Under Australia's current legislation, the Chinese
experiment would be illegal.
